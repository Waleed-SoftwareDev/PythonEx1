# Simple User prompt checker
# This program checks if two strings are equal or not using == and != operators

string1 = input("Enter the first string: ")
string2 = input("Enter the second string: ")

# Using == operator
if string1 == string2:
    print("Both strings are equal.")
else:
    print("Both strings are NOT equal.")

# Using != operator
if string1 != string2:
    print("The strings are different.")
else:
    print("The strings are the same.")

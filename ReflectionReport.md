Creating my technical portfolio on Clippings and GitHub has always been a thought in the back of my head for the past couple of weeks that I have been in this program. I've heard of these places being great ways to make a portfolio, with the job market being so rough lately. I know I needed a place to be able to showcase my skills and show my progression as a developer to differentiate myself from the rest of the crowd. This assignment has been a valuable learning experience that has leveled up both my technical skills and professional development. At the start, I viewed GitHub primarily as a place to store code, but throughout this process, I came to appreciate its full potential as a platform for showcasing my work and documenting my growth as a developer.

One of the first challenges I faced was organizing my repositories in a way that was both clear and professional. I learned the importance of using proper file structures, and maintaining clean, well-commented code. This was a fun project to help me understand how developers showcase their code. I now feel more confident in sharing my work and using GitHub as a key part of my career development moving forward.

One of the things I enjoyed was how easy the layout for Clippings is, the way it adds a picture and description automatically when you post a link. Same with GitHub, the layout is a bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, you start to understand why things are placed that way, which makes for a great UI and easy user experience.

Overall, I'm happy that we get to build out portfolios as part of the curriculum in some of our classes moving forward. I will definitely keep adding things to my GitHub and clippings to make sure I take advantage of what they have to offer and to help me succeed in today's job market.
